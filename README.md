This application is an AR program that runs on android for connecting to a Festo cyberphysical factory.
the applicaiton is bespoke to the factory and will require rebuilding to operate in any other setup
(due primarily to different IP addresses and OPC node ID's)

The server control master script contains all the server IP addresses and most of the unique Node IDs for the main variables.
